## google-maps-review

This repository contains a script designed to extract comments associated with a specific location on Google Maps and perform sentiment analysis on them. To use the program, simply provide the URL of the location to extract the comments. The program will then navigate to the location's page on Google Maps and retrieve all the comments associated with it. To sort the comments based on their relevance to the location, the program uses a sorting algorithm that takes into account various factors such as the number of likes, date of posting, and content of the comment. This ensures that the most relevant and useful comments are analyzed. The comments may be in a language other than English, making them difficult to analyze. To overcome this hurdle, the comments are translated into English using a translation service or library. This enables the program to analyze and classify all the comments based on their sentiment. Finally, the VADER model is applied to perform sentiment analysis on the comments.
