## google-maps-review

 This repository is to extract the comments associated with a specific location on Google Maps. This can be achieved by providing the URL of the location to the program or script. Once the URL is provided, the program should navigate to the location's page on Google Maps and retrieve all the comments associated with it.

However, not all comments may be relevant or useful. Therefore, the comments should be sorted based on their relevance to the location. This can be done by using a sorting algorithm that takes into account various factors such as the number of likes, date of posting, and content of the comment.

Furthermore, some comments may be in a language other than English, making them difficult to analyze. To overcome this hurdle, the comments should be translated to English using a translation service or library. This will enable the program to analyze and classify all the comments based on their sentiment.

Lastly, the Vader model can be applied to perform sentiment analysis on the comments. The Vader model is a rule-based sentiment analysis tool that can analyze text data and classify it as either positive, negative, or neutral. By applying the Vader model to the comments, the program can determine the overall sentiment associated with the location and use this information to make informed decisions.
